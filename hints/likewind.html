    <div class="question">
        Could you tell me how to start solving this mission?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        First of all, you need to determine your own coordinates, as well as the coordinates of C (compass), S (spyglass), and M (map).

    <div class="question">
        Could you show an example of the code? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Code will look look this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
y = [0, 0]
c = [0, 0]
m = [0, 0]
s = [0, 0]

for i in range(len(seaside)):
    for j in range(len(seaside[i])):
        if seaside[i][j] == 'Y':
            y = [i, j]
        elif seaside[i][j] == 'C':
            c = [i, j]
        elif seaside[i][j] == 'M':
            m = [i, j]
        elif seaside[i][j] == 'S':
            s = [i, j]
        </pre>
First, you create variables with the lists of coordinates and assign them values [0, 0]. After that, using a loop, you need to check each element of a two-dimensional array and write its coordinates in the corresponding variable.

    <div class="question">
        How can I calculate the total number of steps, knowing the coordinates?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need to determine the difference in the coordinates between your location and the position of a particular item, and then select the maximum of the two values - horizontal and vertical. You can do this by using the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max'>max() function</a>..
After that youâ€™ll need to perform similar actions in relation to the other two items and calculate the sum of the three distances.

    <div class="question">
        I need to see an example of the code to understand. 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For convenience, you can write this part of the solution in a separate function:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def dist(a, b):
    return max(abs(a[0]-b[0]), abs(a[1]-b[1]))
</pre>
        where a and b - the lists of coordinates of your positions and the position of one of the items.
