        Could you tell me how to start solving this mission?

    <div class="answer">
        First of all, you need to determine your own coordinates, as well as the coordinates of C (compass), S (spyglass), and M (map).

    <div class="question">
        How can I do that? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
First, you create variables with the lists of coordinates and assign them values [0, 0]. After that, using a loop, you need to check each element of a two-dimensional array and write its coordinates in the corresponding variable.

    <div class="question">
        How can I calculate the total number of steps, knowing the coordinates?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need to determine the difference in the coordinates between your location and the position of a particular item, and then select the maximum of the two values - horizontal and vertical.
After that youâ€™ll need to perform similar actions in relation to the other two items and calculate the sum of the three distances.
